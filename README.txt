README

This is a project to build out a restaurants of Savannah database using excel.
Two seperate csv databases will be used. One for restaurants that I would like to try, and one for restaurants already tried.
Restaurants to try database is to_try.csv, restaurants tried and rated database is visited.csv.
In the final state, the restaurants file should be run and restaurants will be added or viewed.
If a restaurant that is on the to_try list is added to the review list, it will automatically be deleted from the to_try list.

This project will also include data visualization of both lists with filtering options.
This includes viewing all, searching for a specific restaurant in the list, and searching using a specific type of food.
Restaurants from the visited list can also be sorted by the rating.


TO DO:
Find a better way to re-prompt the user rather than exiting the code when an invalid input is used.
Delete restaurants added to the review list
Better way to print the results of queries, need to work with the tabulate library to keep it consistant.
Find a way to sort the restaurants visited by rating and print for the user to see.
